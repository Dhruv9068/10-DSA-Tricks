# Java DSA Tricks

This project contains a curated list of **compact and useful Java tricks** specifically tailored for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems. These are not full algorithmic approaches like two-pointer or sliding window â€” instead, they focus on **minimizing code**, **removing boilerplate**, and **writing cleaner, faster Java code** during competitive programming or DSA interviews.

## ðŸ”§ What's Inside

The file `JavaDSATricks.java` includes 10 practical Java coding shortcuts, such as:

1. **`Arrays.fill()`**  
   Quickly initialize an array with a fixed value.

2. **`Map.getOrDefault()`**  
   Retrieve values from a map without null checks.

3. **`Map.computeIfAbsent()`**  
   Initialize map values (like lists) in one line.

4. **`StringBuilder`**  
   Efficiently build strings during iterations or recursion.

5. **`Set.add()` Return Check**  
   Instantly detect duplicates without extra conditions.

6. **`Collections.frequency()`**  
   Count how many times an element appears in a list.

7. **`List â†’ Set`**  
   Remove duplicates using a one-liner.

8. **`Arrays.asList()`**  
   Quickly convert arrays to lists.

9. **`List.toArray()`**  
   Convert a list back to an array in one line.

10. **`Collections.reverse()`**  
   Reverse any list using a single line.

- Reduce code size
- Avoid redundant null/loop checks
- Improve readability
- Write production-level logic even during contests
